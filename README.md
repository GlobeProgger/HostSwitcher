# HostSwitcher

I made a few modifications to the excellent code for creating a tray host switching application found [here](https://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/creating-tray-applications-in-.net-a-practical-guide/).
I wanted to be able to see the current host entry at a glance.  I first tried using the hover help but found it was limited to a specific text length.  My host file was getting fairly large so I
ended up modifying the popup window to include the current entry instead.
